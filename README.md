# AtomTrapLab_auto
Automation project for Dr.Gillen's lab. Automate feedback error correction.

*This project repo contained initial functionality for early lab automation attempts. The main features attempted included Rb peak detecting. This will need to be updated / reworked to configure with both our new voltage / frequency scan's range, as well as our new lab elecronics and software.*


# TODO Sub-Pr ojects:
- [ ] Find minimums of SA plot
- [ ] Connect python blocks
- [ ] Find threashold current
- [ ] Fabry Perot data/find peaks
- [ ] Connect automation code to lab equipment
